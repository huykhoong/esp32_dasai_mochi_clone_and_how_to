[ENGLISH] This project is a clone of Dasai Mochi, the adorable animated character made popular on YouTube. Designed to run on the ESP32 microcontroller, the system renders animated emotes on a TFT display by converting GIFs to C++ code using the powerful tool gif2cpp.


â€¢ Project highlights:
â€ƒâ—¦ Displaying animated Mochi emotes on oled screen
â€ƒâ—¦ Using gif2cpp (https://huykhong.com/IOT/gif2cpp) to convert GIFs into lightweight C++ arrays
â€ƒâ—¦ Built on ESP32 
â€ƒâ—¦ Runs smooth 15 FPS animations on ILI9341 / ST7789 displays
â€ƒâ—¦ Ideal for robotic expressions, smart assistants, or pure cuteness


â€¢ What is gif2cpp?
https://huykhong.com/IOT/gif2cpp
gif2cpp is an open-source tool that converts animated GIFs into C++ header files â€“ perfect for embedding animations in microcontroller projects where you can't use real-time video formats.


â€¢ How to use:

â€ƒ1. Extract emote sections using ffmpeg:
â€ƒâ€ƒâ†’ ffmpeg -ss ... -to ... -i full.mp4 ... -y emote.gif
â€ƒ2. Run gif2cpp to generate .h file
â€ƒ3. Include in your ESP32 project.
